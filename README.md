# Text-Summarization

Our project essentially focuses on extractive summarization.

## Extractive Summarization
1 Selects and extracts key sentences or phrases directly from the source text.


2 Retains the original wording and structure of the selected content.


3 Relies on identifying important sentences based on statistical or linguistic features.


4 Typically involves ranking sentences based on relevance or importance scores.


5 Simplifies the summarization process by directly using existing content.
